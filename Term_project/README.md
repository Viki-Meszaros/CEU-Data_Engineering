Data Engineering Term Project

This folder contains the materials created for my data engineering term project. 

1. I started with importing the data and creating a operational data layer (1_Operational_data_layer.sql)
2. Then built a analytical data layer from by operational one, as well as an ETL pipeline and three data marts (2_Term_project_codes.sql)
3. The third sql files contains codes I used to have a deeper understanding of the data I had. I uploaded it as a supportive material (3_Supporting_Codes.sql)
A diagram of the data set is also included in the folder. 

For my analysis I used the Northwind data set, which was created by Microsoft. It contains the sales data for Northwind Traders, 
a fictitious specialty foods export-import company between 1996-07-04 and 1998-05-06. It has 11 seperate data tables.
