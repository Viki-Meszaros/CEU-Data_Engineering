# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #

-- The Northwind data set contains data about a fictitious specialty foods exportÂ­import company. 
-- We have data on the orders made, the employees who worked on each, the customers who ordered,
-- shippers applied, suppliers, products and categories which were delivered. First I needed to create analyze
-- analytical data store, which contains all the relevant information for further analysis. After this I created 
-- an automatic trigger, which updates my analytical data store whenever new order is entered to the data set. 
-- The final aim of my analysis is to create data marts first one which shows the products in the bevarages category 
-- to help an product category manager, the second is a mart for all the country level order stats within Europe and
-- the last to see the workload of the employees with the help of the countries belonging to them.

#                 ANALYTICAL DATA STORE                   #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
-- Creating a denormalized snapshot of the operational tables to see useful data for the sales of the company.
-- For this I included for each OrderID, the date of the order, the data of shipping, the days between these two to see how many days 
-- a customer have to wait from making the order until the product is shipped to them. I included the name of the products (one order may contain one ar many products),
-- the categories each product belong to, the price per unit, the quantity ordered, and the calculated revenue (UnitPrice*Quantity). Beside these this sales data contains
-- the company who made the order, the one who supplied the product and the shipper and the employee who handeled the ordered.
--  Last but not least we have counry, to se where the revenue is coming from.
